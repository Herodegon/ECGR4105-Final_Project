# ECGR4105-Final_Project
## Meteostat Weather Prediction Model
## Written By: RJ Jock, Michael Delgrosso
## Last Updated: 8/7/2024

## This project gives the user a breakdown of the loss and accuracy of four different models for predicting average temperature on a given day using data obtained from Meteostat and curated into a usable form. These four models are:
### 1. SGDRegressor
### 2. Linear Neural Network
### 3. DecisionTreeRegressor
### 4. LinearSVR

## How To Use This Project:
1. Go down to the block titled `Dataset`.
2. Change the dataset start and end dates, as well as location to your own preference
    * Note: If there are any issues with the chosen dates and location, or you would like to go back to the models defaults, please set all values to the default equivalents seen in the block above `Dataset`.
3. That's it! Once you've set these values, all models will update accordingly. To analyze the results, see the blocks titled `Test` following the training blocks of each model.
